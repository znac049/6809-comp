# 6809-comp

This project started as a way of me learning about VHDL. I've started with Grant Searle's FPGA based multicomp (http://searle.hostei.com/grant/Multicomp/index.html) which is a truly wonderful thing - huge kudos, Grant! I've used one of his basic suggested configurations to create a 6809 system with ROM, RAM, SDCard and serial I/O
